# Program Description

This program focuses on building a Spring Boot application with REST API endpoints for file upload, download, security, validation, error handling, and database integration. The program is divided into multiple parts:

## Part 1: File Upload Endpoint
- Implement an API endpoint in your Spring Boot application that accepts file uploads.
- Configure the endpoint to receive multipart/form-data requests.
- Write code to handle the uploaded file and store it on the server or in cloud storage (e.g., Amazon S3).
- Test the file upload functionality using tools like cURL or Postman.

## Part 2: File Download Endpoint
- Extend your application to include an API endpoint for file download.
- Design the endpoint to receive a file ID or other identifier as a parameter.
- Implement code to retrieve the file based on the identifier and return it as a downloadable resource in the API response.
- Test the file download functionality by calling the API endpoint and verifying that the file is successfully downloaded.

## Part 3: Secure File Upload and Download Endpoints
- Enhance the file upload and download endpoints with authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Configure Spring Security to protect the endpoints and allow access only to authenticated and authorized users.
- Implement user authentication using techniques like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based authentication.
- Apply role-based access control to ensure only users with specific privileges can perform file upload and download operations.

## Part 4: File Validation and Error Handling
- Add validation logic to your file upload endpoint to check for file size, file type, or other constraints.
- Handle validation errors and provide meaningful error messages to the API consumers.
- Implement error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected errors during file upload and download operations.
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes and error responses to indicate the success or failure of the operations.

## Part 5: File Storage with Metadata and Database Integration
- Extend your file upload functionality to store metadata about the uploaded files in a database.
- Design and implement a database schema to store information such as file name, size, upload timestamp, and user information (if applicable).
- Modify the file download endpoint to retrieve file metadata from the database and provide additional information in the API response.
- Implement features like listing uploaded files, searching for files by name or metadata, and managing file permissions.
