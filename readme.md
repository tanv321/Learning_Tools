# Learning Tools

## Description
This project serves as a personal learning tool where I explore various programming languages and technologies. It contains a collection of small projects and exercises that I've worked on to keep my skills sharp and expand my knowledge.

## Technologies Used
- Python/Django
- Java/Maven
- JavaScript/React
- C

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into separate folders for each programming language or technology. Within each folder, you will find individual projects or exercises related to that specific language or technology. Each project may have its own README.md file with detailed information about its purpose, functionality, and instructions for running the code.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to provide a platform for me to experiment with different programming languages, frameworks, and concepts. It allows me to practice coding, explore new technologies, and keep my skills up to date. While some projects may be simple or experimental in nature, they collectively represent my continuous learning journey.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the different folders and projects within this repository. Each project has its own set of instructions and dependencies outlined in its respective README.md file. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me.
