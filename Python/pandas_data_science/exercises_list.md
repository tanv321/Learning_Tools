# Exercise 1:
- create a Python class called "DataAnalyzer" that represents a data analyzer. The class should have attributes for the data file path and the loaded data as a pandas DataFrame. Implement methods to load data from a CSV file, display the summary statistics of the data, and perform basic data manipulations such as filtering, sorting, and grouping.

# Exercise 2:
- create a Python class called "DataVisualizer" that represents a data visualizer. The class should have attributes for the data file path and the loaded data as a pandas DataFrame. Implement methods to load data from a CSV file, visualize the data using various plots (e.g., bar chart, line plot, scatter plot), and generate descriptive visualizations like histograms and box plots.

# Exercise 3:
- create a Python class called "DataPreprocessor" that represents a data preprocessor. The class should have attributes for the data file path and the loaded data as a pandas DataFrame. Implement methods to load data from a CSV file, handle missing values in the data (e.g., imputation, removal), perform data normalization or scaling, and encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

# Exercise 4:
- create a Python class called "DataAnalyzerSQL" that represents a data analyzer using SQL queries. The class should have attributes for the database connection and the loaded data as a pandas DataFrame. Implement methods to connect to a SQL database, load data from a specific table, execute SQL queries to perform data aggregations, joins, and filtering, and retrieve the results as a pandas DataFrame.

# Exercise 5:
- create a Python class called "DataAnalyzerTimeSeries" that represents a time series data analyzer. The class should have attributes for the data file path and the loaded data as a pandas DataFrame with a date/time index. Implement methods to load time series data from a CSV file, perform time-based analysis (e.g., resampling, rolling statistics), and visualize time series data using line plots, seasonal decomposition, and autocorrelation plots.

# Exercise 6:
- create a Python class called "DataAnalyzerMachineLearning" that represents a data analyzer for machine learning tasks. The class should have attributes for the data file path and the loaded data as a pandas DataFrame. Implement methods to load data from a CSV file, split the data into training and testing sets, preprocess the data for machine learning algorithms (e.g., feature scaling, handling categorical variables), and evaluate the performance of different machine learning models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

# Exercise 7:
- create a Python class called "DataAnalyzerText" that represents a text data analyzer. The class should have attributes for the data file path and the loaded text data as a pandas DataFrame. Implement methods to load text data from a file, perform text preprocessing tasks (e.g., tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming), analyze the frequency of words using word clouds and bar charts, and apply text mining techniques like sentiment analysis or topic modeling.

# Exercise 8:
- create a Python class called "DataAnalyzerWebScraping" that represents a web scraping data analyzer. The class should have attributes for the target website URL and the scraped data as a pandas DataFrame. Implement methods to scrape data from a specific website, extract relevant information using web scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup, clean and preprocess the scraped data, and perform analysis or visualization tasks on the extracted data.
